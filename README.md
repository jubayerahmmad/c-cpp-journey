# C/C++ Learning and Problem Solving

This repository contains my journey of learning C and C++ programming languages. It includes basic programs, problem-solving approaches, and contest solutions. I'm using this repository to track my progress, practice problem-solving, and build a foundation in competitive programming.

## Goals

- Learn the syntax and features of C and C++.
- Build logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Participate in coding contests and improve speed and accuracy.

## Status

Ongoing learning and practice. This repo will grow as I continue solving problems and experimenting with code.
