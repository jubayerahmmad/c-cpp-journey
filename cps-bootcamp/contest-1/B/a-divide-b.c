/**
 * A/B problem
 *
 * Write a program which reads two integers a and b, and calculates the following values:
 * a รท b: d (in integer)
 * remainder of a รท b: r (in integer)
 * a รท b: f (in real number)
 * Input
 * Two integers a and b are given in a line.
 * Output
 * Print d, r and f separated by a space in a line. For f, the output should not contain an absolute error greater than 10-5.
