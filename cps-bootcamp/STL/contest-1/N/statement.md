## Problem Statement

Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly _n_ days. He knows that on the _i_-th day (1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _n_) he makes _aᵢ_ money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence _aᵢ_. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!

## Input

The first line contains integer _n_ (1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 10⁵).

The second line contains _n_ integers *a*₁, *a*₂, ..., _aₙ_ (1 ≤ _aᵢ_ ≤ 10⁹).

## Output

Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence _a_.
